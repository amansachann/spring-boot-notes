What is SLF4J?
================
- SLF4J stands for Simple Logging Facade For Java
- It has been long since SLF4J came into picture and adopted heavily by many projects all around.
- But certain things never get over like the difference between abstract class and interface in Java.
- Difference between SLF4J and Log4j is still a popular question among 'loggers'.
- I've been asked this question multiple times,
  so I thought to explain my answer so you guys also can understand this better.

=============================================
What is the difference b/w SLF4J and Log4j?
=============================================
- However if we elaborate this question it only deserves a single line answer
  i.e. The question itself is wrong.
- SLF4J and Log4j focus on different areas and they are not similar components.
- SLF4J is a logging facade. SLF4J is Simple Logging Facade for Java.
- It is only an abstraction layer to an underlying logging component.


=========================
SLF4J is not for logging
=========================
- It is not a logging component ands it does not do the actual logging.
  Internally SLF4J will use logging frameworks to generate the actual logs in runtime.
- We can configure any logging framework like Log4j or Logback or Java Logging.

===========
Comparison
===========
- Log4j is a logging component and it does the actual logging.
- Logically SLF4J and Log4j are 2 different components.
- If you want to compare SLF4J, then the right comparison would be 
  to compare with Apache Commons Logging.
- Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) is an API designed to 
  give generic access to many logging frameworks; Log4j being one of them.
- SLF4J is not a replacement for Log4J but it works along with it.


================
Implementation
================

import org.slf4j.Logger; 
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HelloWorld.class);
        logger.info("Hello World");
    }
}

- Now all you have to choose, which logging framework you need to use in runtime.
  For that, you will have to include two jar files:
    - SLF4J binding jar file
    - Desired logging framework jar files

- e.g. to use log4j in your project, you'll have to include given jar files:
    - slf4j-log4j12-1.7.12.jar
    - log4j-1.2.17.jar
