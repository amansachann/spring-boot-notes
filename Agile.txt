==========================================
What is Software Development Life Cycle
==========================================
-> The SDLC refers to a methodology.
-> SDLC clearly defines the process of creating high-quality software project. 
-> SDLC methodology focuses on below phases of software development: 
        1. Requirement Analysis
        2. Planning
        3. Software Design or Architecture Design
        4. Development
        5. Testing
        6. Deployment
        7. Support
-> We have several methodologies in SDLC:
        1. Waterfall Model 
        2. V-Model 
        3. Spiral Model 
        4. Agile Model 

================
WaterFall Model
================
-> Waterfall Model introduced in 1970. 
-> The waterfall model was the first model introduced as process model.
-> It is a linear or sequential approach to develop software project.
-> It is also called as step by step approach to develop the project.
-> In this model we will complete only one phase then we will move on to next phase. 

==============================
When to use WaterFall Model?
==============================
-> When requirements are fixed.
-> When Project is small.
-> When budget is fixed.

==================================
Disadvantages of WaterFall Model
==================================
-> Risk is high
-> Requirements can't be changed
-> We can't go to previous phase
-> Testing will happen at the end
-> Client involvement is very less

==================
Agile Methodology
==================
-> Agile is one of the SDLC methodology.
-> It is a way to manage the project by breaking the project into several phases.
-> Agile is also called as iterative approach to develop and deliver the project.
-> We can achieve continuous development and continuous delivery using Agile.
-> It involves constant collaboration with stake holders.
-> Continuous improvement at every stage.
-> Client feedback is most critical part in Agile.
-> In Agile, Planning, Implementing, Testing, and Delivering is a cyclic process.

==================
Agile Terminology
==================
-> Backlog Grooming:  Team meeting to identify pending works
-> Stories: Tasks (work)
-> Story Points: Duration to complete the story (3 points - 1 day, 5 points - 2 days, 8 points - 3 days)
-> Sprint Planning: Team meeting to identify priority stories to work
-> Sprint: Set of stories to complete (Sprint Goal) & Sprint Duration (2 weeks - 10 working days)
-> Scrum: It is a process (Daily team meeting to discuss work status - 15-20 mins)
-> Retrospective: Review meeting after sprint(s) completed (2-3 sprints)
                (What went well, What went wrong, achievements, improvements,
                lessons learnt, new ideas)

===================
Agile Team Members
===================
-> Product Owner: Responsible for deliverables
-> Scrum Master: Who will manage agile teams
-> Tech Lead: Senior team member (who will help team members technically)
-> Team Member: Developers and Testers

Agile team size: 7-10 teams (as per industry)
