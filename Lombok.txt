Project Lombok
================
- "Boilerplate" is a term used to describe code that is repeated in many
  parts of application with little alteration.

- One of the most frequently voiced criticisms of the Java language is 
  the volume of this type of code that is found in most projects.

- Project Lombok aims to reduce the prevalence of some of the worst offenders
  by replacing them with simple set of annotations.

==============
Installation
==============
- Project Lombok is available as a single jar file on website https://projectlombok.org/
- It includes the APIs for development as an installer for IDE integration.

===================
Lombok Annotations
===================
- It is not uncommon for a typical java project to devote hundreds of lines of
  code to the boilerplate required for defining simple data classes. These classes
  generally contain number of fields, getters and setters for those fields, as well as
  equals and hashCode implementations. In simplest scenarios, Project Lombok can reduce these
  classes to required fields and a single @Data annotation.

- Of course, the simplest scenarios are not necessarily the ones that developers face on a
  day-to-day basis. For that reason, there are number of annotations in Project Lombok to allow
  more fine grained control over the structure and behavior of a class. 

Annotations:
  - @Getter 
  - @Setter 
  - @GetterAndSetter 
  - @NoArgConstructor
  - @EqualsAndHashCode
  - @AllArgsConstructor
  - @Data 
  - @CleanUp etc...

===================
@EqualsAndHashCode
===================

- This class level annotation will cause Lombok to generate both equals and hashCode methods, 
  as the two are tied together intrinsically by the hashCode contract.

- By default, any field in the class that is not static or transient will be considered by 
  both methods. Much like @ToString, the exclude parameter is provided to prevent field from 
  being included in the generated logic. One can also use the of parameter to list only those 
  fields should be considered.

======
@Data 
======
- The @Data annotation is likely the most frequently used annotation in the Project Lombok toolset.
- It combines the functionality of @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, @Getter and @Setter.
- Essentially, using @Data on a class is the same as annotating the class with a default @ToString and @EqualsAndHashCode as well as annotating each field with both @Getter and @Setter.
- Annotation a class with @Data also triggers Lombok's constructor generation. 
  This adds a public constructor that takes any @NonNull or final fields as parameters. 
  This provides everything needed for a Plain Old Java Object (POJO).

=================
Costs & Benefits
=================
- As with any technology choice, there are both positive and negative effects of using 
 Project Lombok. Incorporating Lombok's annotations in a project can greatly reduce the 
 number of lines of boilerplate code that are either generated in the IDE or written by hand. 
 This results in reduced maintenance overhead, fewer bugs and more readable classes.

- Project Lombok is largely aimed at filling gaps in the Java language. when used in combination
  with annotation-based object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks, the number of annotations 
  on data classes can begin to get unwieldy. This is largely offset by the amount of code that 
  is superseded by the Lombok annotations. However, those who shun the frequent use of 
  annotations may choose to look the other way.


================
What's Missing?
================
Project Lombok provides the delombok utility for replacing the Lombok annotations 
with equivalent source code. This can be done for an entire source directory via the 
command line.

java -jar lombok.jar delombok src -d src-delomboked

============
Limitations
============
- While Project Lombok does some dramatic things to make a developer's life easier, 
  it has its limitations.
- One important problem is the inability to detect the constructors of a superclass. 
  This means that if a superclass has no default constructor any subclasses cannot use 
  the @Data annotation without explicitly writing a constructor to make use of the available 
  superclass constructor.

============
Controversy
============
- A number of issues have been raised against the use of Project Lombok. 
  The most common argument holds that annotations were intended for "meta" information 
  and are not to be used in such a way that would leave the codebase unable to be compiled 
  were they removed.
- This is certainly the situation with Lombok annotations. 
  New methods result from these annotations that are intended to be used not only 
  by a framework, but by other parts of the application. Project Lombok's development-time 
  support is its bread and butter, but this does have consequences, not the least of which 
  is limited IDE support.

========
Summary
========
Project Lombok is a powerful tool for the pragmatic developer. 
It provides a set of useful annotations for eliminating a tremendous amount of boilerplate 
code from your Java classes. In the best cases, a mere five characters can replace hundreds 
of lines of code. The result is Java classes that are clean, concise and easy to maintain.
